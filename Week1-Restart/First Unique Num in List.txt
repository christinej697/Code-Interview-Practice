First Non-Repeating Integer in a List
--------------------------------------

Given a list, find the first integer which is unique in the list.

Input: List of ints, Output: int

Ideas: Loop through the list. On each loop, when see a number for the first time, store in once seen list. If see a number on first time again, add it to the non-unique list. Once you have gone through, take the first number from seen list that is not in the non-unique list and return it.
